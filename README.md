# btutils
An R package for back testing. I consider most of the code deprecated. Still,
there are some goodies, like <em>construct.indicator</em>. [This blob post](http://www.quintuitive.com/2015/06/21/trading-moving-averages-with-less-whipsaws/) contains an usage example.

## Installation
    devtools::install_github("ivannp/btutils")
